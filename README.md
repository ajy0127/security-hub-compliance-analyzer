[![CI/CD Pipeline](https://github.com/ajy0127/securityhub_soc2analysis/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ajy0127/securityhub_soc2analysis/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## A Portfolio-Building Project for GRC Professionals

This lab project is designed specifically for Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) professionals who want to enhance their technical skills and build a practical portfolio demonstrating cloud security compliance expertise.

## Why This Project Matters for Your GRC Portfolio

As a GRC professional, demonstrating practical experience with cloud compliance tools is increasingly valuable. This project allows you to:

- **Showcase SOC 2 Knowledge**: Demonstrate your understanding of SOC 2 controls in a practical context
- **Bridge the Technical Gap**: Build confidence working with cloud security tools without needing deep technical expertise
- **Create Tangible Deliverables**: Generate professional compliance reports you can showcase to potential employers
- **Learn AWS Security Basics**: Gain hands-on experience with AWS SecurityHub in a guided environment

## What You'll Learn

This lab will help you understand:

1. **How AWS SecurityHub Works**: Learn how cloud security findings are generated and managed
2. **SOC 2 Control Mapping**: See how technical findings map to SOC 2 compliance requirements
3. **Compliance Reporting**: Create professional reports suitable for auditors and executives
4. **Basic Cloud Automation**: Experience how compliance monitoring can be automated

## Project Overview (Non-Technical)

This solution automatically:
1. Collects security findings from AWS SecurityHub
2. Maps those findings to relevant SOC 2 controls
3. Uses AI to analyze the compliance impact
4. Generates and emails professional reports

Think of it as an automated compliance assistant that helps you monitor SOC 2 requirements in AWS.

## Getting Started (For Non-Technical Users)

This lab is designed to be accessible even if you have limited technical experience. You have two options:

### Option 1: Follow Along with the Tutorial (Recommended for Beginners)

We've created a step-by-step tutorial that walks you through the project without requiring you to write code:

1. [Download the tutorial PDF](https://example.com/tutorial.pdf) (Coming soon)
2. Follow the screenshots and instructions
3. Use our pre-configured AWS CloudFormation template to deploy the solution

### Option 2: Hands-On Deployment (For Those Ready to Try)

If you're feeling more adventurous and want to get hands-on:

1. Create a free AWS account (or use an existing one)
2. Follow our [Deployment Guide for GRC Professionals](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
3. Use the solution to generate your first compliance report

## Sample Deliverables for Your Portfolio

After completing this lab, you'll have several artifacts to add to your professional portfolio:

1. **SOC 2 Compliance Reports**: Professional-looking reports mapping AWS findings to SOC 2 controls
2. **Compliance Dashboard**: Screenshots of your compliance monitoring setup
3. **Project Implementation**: Documentation of your deployment process
4. **Risk Analysis**: Sample analysis of security findings and their compliance impact

## Understanding the Components (Simplified)

This solution consists of several parts, explained in non-technical terms:

1. **The Collector** (Lambda Function): Automatically gathers security findings on a schedule
2. **The Mapper** (SOC2Mapper): Translates technical security findings into SOC 2 control language
3. **The Analyzer** (AI Component): Reviews findings and generates compliance insights
4. **The Reporter** (Email Component): Creates and delivers professional reports

## Customizing for Your Portfolio

You can customize this project to demonstrate your unique GRC expertise:

1. **Modify Control Mappings**: Edit the mappings.json file to show your understanding of SOC 2 controls
2. **Customize Report Format**: Adjust the email template to showcase your reporting style
3. **Add Additional Controls**: Extend the project to include other compliance frameworks you're familiar with

## FAQ for GRC Professionals

**Q: Do I need coding experience to use this?**  
A: No! The step-by-step guide allows you to deploy and use the solution without writing code.

**Q: Will this cost money to run?**  
A: AWS offers a free tier that should cover most of your usage. We recommend setting up billing alerts.

**Q: Can I use this for actual compliance monitoring?**  
A: This is designed as a learning tool. For production environments, additional security and reliability considerations would be needed.

**Q: How do I explain this project in interviews?**  
A: We've included talking points in the [Interview Guide](INTERVIEW_GUIDE.md) to help you articulate what you've learned.

## Next Steps After Completing This Lab

After you've completed this lab, consider these next steps for your GRC portfolio:

1. **Add Multi-Framework Support**: Extend the project to map findings to other frameworks like NIST or ISO 27001
2. **Create Executive Dashboards**: Design visual summaries of compliance status
3. **Develop Remediation Workflows**: Outline processes for addressing compliance gaps
4. **Document Your Journey**: Write a blog post or LinkedIn article about what you learned
